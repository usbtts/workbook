The following are Log4j committers who accept sponsorship through GitHub. GitHub sponsorship can be used simply as a way to say thank you for the work that has been done or as a way to encourage specific issues to be worked on. In either case, while the Apache Logging Services Project thanks you for your support we cannot be responsible for any promises and/or contributions made by an individual committer as individual commits must be reviewed and accepted by the project team. While the Logging Services team has accepted the individuals listed below as committers to the projects, we cannot recommend any particular individual for any specific issue.
